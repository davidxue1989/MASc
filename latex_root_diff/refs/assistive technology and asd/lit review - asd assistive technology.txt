The term ‘‘assistive technology’’ refers to any device or piece of equipment that
facilitates teaching new skills, augments existing skills, or otherwise reduces the
impact of disability on daily functioning (Bryant et al. 2010; Reichle et al. 2011).

Assistive Technology for Communication:
====================================================================================
People with ASD may experience a wide array of deficits in communication
(American Psychiatric Association 2000; Howlin 2003). People with autism, for
example, may have a very limited spoken repertoire with as many as 61 % failing
to develop speech altogether (Weitz 1997). Whereas people with Asperger’s
syndrome will often develop good speech skills, they may still struggle to communicate
effectively due, in part, to perseveration on preferred conversation topics
(e.g., frequent discussion of trains, the plots of movies, or other topics), unusual
reactions to social cues from conversation partners (e.g., misinterpreting facial
expressions), or anxiety-related to social situations (Scheuermann and Webber
2002). Further, individuals with ASD may engage in a number of stereotypies that
can impede communication, for example, echolalia (i.e., verbatim repeating of
someone else’s words) involves speech but often might appear to lack communicative
intent (Sigafoos et al. 2007a, b, c).

Assistive technology used to support
communication may be referred to as aided augmentative and alternative communication
(AAC) (Sigafoos and Drasgow 2001). Aided AAC systems include
high-tech electronic devices such as speech generating devices (SGD) and more
low-tech materials, such as pictures or symbols that can be pointed to, affixed to a
board, or exchanged with a communication partner (e.g., Bondy and Frost 2002).
Most aided AAC systems involve visual cues (e.g., pictures or symbols) that are
intended to build on the visual processing ability thought to be well developed in
many people with ASD (Mirenda 2001; Shane et al. 2012).

For example, some individuals with ASD may have motor impairments
that could render sign language too difficult to learn. In such cases an aided
AAC, that requires less manual dexterity (e.g., activation of a speech generating
device), might be indicated. Similarly, the ability to imitate the motor behavior of
another person has also been suggested as a prerequisite skill for sign language
training that may not be required for using other types of aided AAC (Bondy and
Frost 2002).

The reviews summarized
in Table 6.1 suggest that the three most common approaches to supporting communication
using assistive technology are speech generating devices (SGD), picture
exchange communication systems (PECS), and computer-based instruction (CBI)
(e.g., Ganz et al. 2012b; Ramdoss et al. 2011; Schlosser and Wendt 2008; van der
Meer and Rispoli 2010).

Speech-Generating Devices. A SGD (also referred to as a Voice Output
Communication Aid (VOCA)) is a portable device that contains one or more panels
or switches that when depressed will activate pre-recorded digitized or synthesized
speech output. These devices range in complexity from a single panel/switch that
plays one message to multiswitch devices that can serve numerous communicative
functions including requesting, commenting, and greeting. Pictures or symbols on
the device indicate to the user what message will be played if a specific switch is
activated. For example, a picture of a favorite toy may be used to indicate that the
message ‘‘May I have my toy please?’’ will be played if the corresponding panel on
the SGD is activated.

There are several potential advantages to using SGD to support communication.
First, they are often highly portable (Mechling 2011). For example, when the
correct software application is installed, a handheld iPod or iPad can be used as a
SGD device, and the ubiquity of such handheld devices among the typically
developing population might also help reduce the stigmatization of using assistive
technology for communication (Kagohara et al. 2013). Second, because electronic
speech is produced, communication attempts may be more easily understood by
most communication partners than more ambiguous forms of AAC such as sign
language (Mirenda 2001). Finally, the SGD models the correct spoken message
during moments when the person is motivated to communicate and some studies
have demonstrated that using a SGD may lead to the acquisition of spoken
communication (Schlosser and Wendt 2008).

Probably because selecting the symbols on the
SGD was intended to serve the same communicative functions as the vocal
stereotypy and was a more efficient way to communicate, vocal stereotypy was
nearly eliminated when the child began independently using the SGD. This study
demonstrated the potential of a SGD to be used across multiple settings, for a
variety of communicative functions, and to reduce problem behavior when the
communicative function of the SGD is matched to that of problem behavior
(c.f., Carr and Durand 1985).

A recent systematic review conducted by van der Meer and Rispoli (2010)
focused on communication interventions involving SGD and children (\18 years
old) with ASD (see Table 6.1).
A variety of
different communication skills were enabled through the use of SGDs, with the
majority of studies (70 %) focused on using the device to request preferred items,
food, or activities. The remainder of the studies utilized SGDs for commenting
(e.g., starting a conversation), answering questions (e.g., selecting between ‘‘yes’’
and ‘‘no’’), and reducing vocal stereotypy. The majority of the reviewed studies
employed single-case experimental designs and demonstrated clear intervention
results. However, it was also noted that there was a lack of randomized control
trials. As such, there appears to be a need for more research involving larger groups
of participants and demonstrating the utility of SGDs for more complex communication
needs, such as sustaining a conversation and asking questions.


The Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). PECS involves teaching
the person with ASD to communicate via handing their partner a picture or symbol
card depicting their communicative intent (Bondy and Frost 2002).

Ganz et al. (2012a) conducted a meta-analysis of 13 PECS intervention studies
involving people with ASD. Only studies using single-case experimental designs
were included in the review. A wide range of effect sizes ((ES) range, –0.51–0.95)
was reported suggesting that PECS is very effective but outcomes hinge on
additional factors. Specifically, PECS was found to be more beneficial for preschool
age participants than elementary or secondary age participants and for
participants with autism without any other comorbid developmental or intellectual
disability diagnosis. Additionally, the effects on targeted dependent variables
(i.e., picture exchange) and effects on collateral ‘‘untargeted’’ dependent variables
(i.e., problem behavior and speech production) were analyzed separately and
compared. Results indicate that the largest ES are associated with targeted
dependent variables and that outcomes for reducing problem behavior and
increasing speech are highly variable but promising.


In addition to increases in picture exchange communication, PECS has also
been shown to be associated with an increase in spoken communication in children
with ASD (e.g., Anderson et al. 2007; Charlop-Christy et al. 2002; Ganz and
Simpson 2004; Ganz et al. 2008; Jurgens et al. 2009; Tincani 2004; Tincani et al.
2006; Yoder and Stone 2006).
Ganz and colleagues
recommend cautious interpretation; specifically, PECS does not hinder speech
production or increase problem behavior but improvements in those variables are
inconsistent across studies. Additional research is necessary to determine the
factors that predict improvements in those variables following PECS training.



Computer-Based Instruction.
Computers can be
considered assistive technology when they are used to deliver or supplement
intervention for people with disability.
CBI differs from the aided AAC
systems (e.g., SGD) because the computer does not usually travel with the individual
to function as a communication modality. Rather, the computer is used to
teach some skill that, once acquired, improves an individual’s communication even
though the computer may not be present.

There are several potential advantages to using CBI to teach people with ASD
communication skills. 

Specifically, a computer is very consistent and predictable
and may therefore be a preferred medium for instructional delivery for people with
ASD who prefer routines and managed expectations (Ramdoss et al. 2011a).


Further, computers can provide a one-to-one instructional format that reduces
distractions and control for autism-specific learning characteristics such as stimulus
overselectivity (Lovaas et al. 1979). 

Finally, 
computers can efficiently and accurately
implement complex reinforcement schedules, provide and fade prompts, and
collect data on participant responses simultaneously while demanding less time and
attention from a teacher or therapist (Ramdoss et al. 2011b; Higgins and Boone
1996). In addition to communication skills, CBI has been used to teach people with
autism social-emotional skills, academics, and daily living skills (Ramdoss et al.
2011a, b, 2012a, b).

Ramdoss et al. (2011a) completed a review on the use of CBI to teach communication
skills to people with ASD.
The potential of
CBI to improve communication has only been evaluated in children 14 years old
or younger diagnosed with autism. There were no studies involving adults or
individuals with Asperger’s syndrome identified in the systematic search procedures.

Massaro and Bosseler (2006) used Baldi to teach five children
with autism to identify specific pictures based on Baldi’s spoken words (i.e.,
receptive language) and then to produce spoken names for those pictures.
The researchers concluded that communication skills can be
increased within an automated program and that the presence of the life-like face
facilitates that process.

The other two programs identified by Ramdoss et al. (2011a) were HyperStudio
and PowerPoint. Those programs are designed to deliver multimedia presentations
and the specific curriculum or presentation must be created by the practitioner. In
those cases, the extent to which the practitioner is able to create a presentation that
utilizes reinforcement, prompting, and other research-based instructional strategies
would seem more likely to predict outcomes than merely the use of the computer.
Further, because the specific presentations used in those studies are not available,
replication of those findings is hindered. Ramdoss, Lang et al. concluded that there
is insufficient evidence to classify CBI as a research-based approach for communication
intervention at this time. However, because all 10 studies demonstrated
at least some improvement for all participants, CBI can be considered a promising
practice for improving communication.

assistive technology to support communication typically
involves use of a device that augments and provides alternative forms of
communication (e.g., PECS and SGD). Those devices are not typically faded out
of communication intervention programs, but remain as a permanent communication
modality.

====================================================================================
Assistive Technology for Social Skills
====================================================================================
The diagnostic criteria for autistic disorder and Asperger’s syndrome both include
deficits in social skills (American Psychiatric Association 2000). For example,
(a) lack of or inappropriate eye contact, (b) failure to develop peer relationships,
(c) lack of joint attention, and (d) qualitative deficits in the extent of social and/or
emotional reciprocity (Rao et al. 2008; White et al. 2007). Further, people with
ASD may have a different understanding of social relationships and the emotions
typically associated with those relationships.

Assistive technology used to support social skills, however, is
more likely to be instructional and the assistive technology may be faded or
eliminated to promote more typical functioning after the target social skill has
been acquired.
For example, Hopkins et al. (2011) used the computer program
FaceSay to provide 49 children with autism opportunities to practice attending to
eye gaze, discriminating between facial expressions, recognizing faces, and
identifying emotions.

In some cases, the support provided by assistive technology may be difficult to
fade or eliminate. Shabani et al. (2002), for example, used a pager that vibrated
using a remote control to prompt three children with autism to initiate a social
interaction with other children during play and to respond to the bids for social
interaction made by other children.

assistive technology has
been successfully used to improve social and emotional functioning of people with
ASD (Bellini and Akullian 2007; Rao et al. 2008; Reed et al. 2011; Shukla-Mehta
et al. 2010; White et al. 2007).

Reed and colleagues conducted a systematic review
of 29 intervention studies focused on the use of assistive technology to teach social
skills to children with autism. They found that assistive technology had been used
to teach children with ASD to: (a) initiate conversations, (b) engage in more
sophisticated and social forms of play, (c) utilize social conventions and norms
during conversations, (d) respond to the social initiations of others, (e) solve social
problems, and (f) identify and regulate emotions and emotional reciprocity. Most
of the studies were implemented in applied settings (e.g., schools and homes),
utilized sound experimental procedures, included standardized assessments, and
resulted in improved social skills.

A variety of assistive technology interventions
were utilized including CBI (described in the preceding section) and script training
(e.g., listening or reading a scripted conversation); however, the most common
form of assistive technology used to teach social and emotional skills was video
modeling (see Table 6.2). Video modeling and script training are therefore discussed
in more detail.

Video Modeling.
Video modeling involves watching a
video of the target skill being performed and then imitating the modeled behavior
or skill (Bellini and Akullian 2007). In addition to social skills, video modeling has
been used to teach motor skills, communication skills, self-monitoring, vocational
skills, and emotional regulation to people with and without developmental disability
(Bellini et al. 2007; Hitchcock et al. 2003).

Rayner et al. (2009) identified
several variations of video modeling. Specifically, the video may be shot from a
first-person point of view (i.e., the observer sees as if through the eyes of the
person performing the skill) or from a third-person point of view (i.e., the observer
sees a person perform the skill). The person performing the skill is referred to as
the model and the model may be a peer, therapist, or the same person with ASD
that is receiving the intervention. When the person watching the video is also the
model, the intervention may be referred to as video self-modeling (VSM).

VSM is often used when the person occasionally performs the target skill, but
the goal of intervention is to increase the rate of occurrence or bring the occurrence
of the behavior under the control of some environmental stimulus. If the person
with ASD has never engaged in the target skill (precluding it being filmed), a selfmodeling
video can still be created by editing to remove prompts or to string
together several video segments depicting components of the skill, so that the
person with ASD can watch himself or herself perform the entire target skill
independently even if they have never actually done so in the past (Rayner et al.
2009).

There are several potential advantages to using video modeling to improve the
social skills of children with ASD. First, once the video is created, it can be used
repeatedly and this repetition and consistency may be particularly conducive to
skill acquisition in people with ASD (Ogilvie 2011). Second, video modeling may
be a relatively easy intervention for practitioners and typically takes only a few
minutes to run the video training session (Shukla-Mehta et al. 2010). Third, in the
case of VSM, people with ASD may learn to visualize themselves being successful,
which might facilitate the acquisition of other similar skills. In addition to
these potential advantages, there is sufficient empirical evidence to support the use
of video modeling for teaching individuals with ASD (e.g., Ayers and Langone
2005; Bellini and Akullian 2007; Delano 2007; McCoy and Hermansen 2007;
Mechling 2005; Rayner et al. 2009; Shukla-Mehta et al. 2010).

However, previous reviews into the efficacy of video modeling as a technologyassisted
teaching procedure for individuals with ASD (e.g., Ayers and Langone
2005; Bellini and Akullian 2007; Delano 2007; McCoy and Hermansen 2007;
Mechling 2005; Rayner et al. 2009; Shukla-Mehta et al. 2010) have highlighted
several unanswered questions regarding video modeling that should be addressed
in future research. Specifically, the majority of studies utilizing video modeling
have involved other nonassistive technology components (e.g., direct prompting
and reinforcement from a trainer) implemented in tandem with video modeling. In
those studies that lack a component analysis, it is difficult to determine if video
modeling alone would have been effective. Second, it is not currently known what
type of model is most effective for teaching specific skills. For example, is it better
to use peer models or self-models to teach social initiations? Finally, the participant
characteristics associated with positive outcomes following video modeling
need to be delineated to improve the efficiency with which this type of assistive
technology is applied. For example, it is not clear if imitation skills represent a
prerequisite to successful use of video modeling (Lindsay et al. 2013; Rayner et al.
2009).


Script Training. Script training involves the teacher or therapist planning a
specific social interaction in which the spoken lines and/or behavior of one or both
people in the social interaction is scripted. After the social interaction is scripted,
the participant is either given a written copy of the script or hears it from a
recording or a person reading it (Stevenson et al. 2000). The participant is then
placed in the social situation referred to in the script. For example, a child with
ASD could be given a script on what to say and/or how to act while playing with a
peer and then be taken to a play session with a peer. Scripts may also contain
prompts for specific behaviors hypothesized to facilitate the social interaction. For
example, in addition to scripting speech, a script may also prompt the participant
to approach a potential conversation partner, initiate conversation, orientate to the
person speaking, make eye contact, wait while the other person talks, and other
similar behaviors conducive to the target skill (Wichnick et al. 2010).
The goal of script training is not to produce rote scripted responding, but to
offer an opportunity to practice pro-social behaviors. When script training is
successful, the individual with ASD does not follow the script verbatim, but is able
to deviate from the script in socially appropriate ways and express unscripted ideas
(MacDuff et al. 2007). This flexibility and spontaneity during the target social
interaction is accomplished by systematically fading the script over time so that
the person with ASD can assume ever increasing control over the social interaction
as his or her skills improve.

script training appears to be most commonly used to
increase the duration or quality of social interactions (e.g., longer conversations or
extended social play). However, a small number of studies have used script
training to increase more basic social skills. For example, MacDuff et al. (2007)
used audiotaped scripts to increase the frequency of bids for joint attention by
children with autism.

The existing research in support of script training is limited but results like
these suggest additional research investigating the potential benefits of script
training is warranted.



====================================================================================
Assistive Technology for Adaptive and Daily Living Skills
====================================================================================
Adaptive and daily-living skills, such as self-care (e.g., grooming, dressing,
cooking), organization (e.g., time management, money management), and
community or recreational skills (e.g., using public transportation or the library),
have been noted as essential for an individual to function successfully and independently
(Liss et al. 2001). In addition to increasing independence, acquisition of
adaptive and daily living skills might promote self-determination by reducing
passivity and learned helplessness (Parmenter 1993). Unfortunately, individuals
diagnosed with ASD often struggle to acquire the adaptive and daily living skills
necessary to live independently and often come to rely on caregivers for assistance.Smith et al. (2012) 

investigated the daily living skills of a group of 397
adolescents and adults with ASD over a 10-year period. Latent growth curve
modeling indicated that, despite a period of improvement during adolescence and
the early 20s, the daily living skills of people with ASD most often plateau short of
independent functioning.

Several previous literature
reviews have evaluated the intervention research in this area. For instance,
Mechling (2008) reviewed studies focused on teaching cooking skills and found
that the instructions delivered using picture-based systems, hand-held personal
computers, auditory prompting systems, and video models have been effective in
enabling people with ASD and intellectual disability to prepare their own meals.
Similarly, a review conducted by Morse et al. (1996) revealed that video-taped
instructional models and slide show examples can be used to teach grocery
shopping skills. Finally, Palmen et al. (2012) noted the practical utility of a variety
of high and low technology instructional modalities in teaching domestic skills to
individuals with high functioning ASD.
	
The nine studies summarized in Table 6.3 aimed to teach adaptive and daily
living skills to a total of 20 participants. Nineteen of the participants had a
diagnosis of autism and one study involved a participant with a diagnosis of PDDNOS
(Mechling and O’Brien 2010). Eighteen of the participants were male.
Participant ages ranged from 3 to 36 years.

All participants in the studies summarized
in Table 6.3 acquired the targeted adaptive and daily living skills that
were supported or taught using assistive technology.
The same basic approach and
general instructional strategy was used across studies. Specifically, to determine
pre-intervention skill levels, participants were first provided an opportunity to
engage in the target skills in the natural environment and then some form of
assistive technology was used to teach the target skill. Instructional procedures
included prompting, prompt fading, and reinforcement. In order to promote generalization,
study authors incorporated images and videos taken directly from the
natural environment in order to make the instructional environment and materials
more closely resemble the natural environment (Stokes and Baer 1977). Following
intervention, performance was assessed again in the natural environment. In seven
of the nine included studies (Ayres et al. 2009; Mechling and O’Brien 2010;
Rosenberg et al. 2010; Shipley-Benamou et al. 2002; Sigafoos et al. 2005;
Sigafoos et al. 2007a, b, c; van Laarhoven et al. 2010), follow-up probes to assess
the maintenance of acquired skills were also conducted and, in the majority of
cases, the skill was maintained.

Rosenberg et al. (2010)
compared commercially available videotapes and customized videotapes to
examine effectiveness for teaching hand washing skills to three children diagnosed
with autism.

Across the studies, a variety of assistive technology systems were used to
deliver instruction. Three studies evaluated CBI to promote independent and daily
living skills in individuals with ASD (Ayres et al. 2009; Hutcherson 2004;
Mechling and O’Brien 2010). For instance, Ayres et al. (2009) delivered
instructions using a computer software program to teach food preparation and table
setting to three children (ages 7 to 9 years old) with autism. Instruction was
provided by the software program I Can—Daily Living and Community Skills.
This instructional program is designed to present a video simulation of the environment
for three unique tasks (i.e., setting table, making soup, and making
sandwich) and required children to respond by arranging materials in a simulated
environment (e.g., putting utensils on the table). Initially, participants were
assessed in vivo on their ability to complete the selected tasks in the absence of
intervention. CBI was then provided and participants reached the mastery criteria
for each task. Following CBI, in vivo performance was evaluated again and data
indicated the skills had been acquired.

Three studies used portable laptop computers (Sigafoos et al. 2005, 2007a, b, c;
van Laarhoven et al. 2010), two studies used a television and video player
(Rosenberg et al. 2010; Shipley-Benamou et al. 2002), and one study used an
iPhone (Bereznak et al. 2012) to deliver video prompts. For instance, Sigafoos and
colleagues evaluated the effects of computer-delivered video prompting procedures
to teach three adults with developmental disabilities (including one participant with
autism) to make microwave popcorn. Video prompting involved showing a video
clip of one step of the making popcorn task analysis at a time. Following the video
prompt, participants were given the opportunity to initiate and complete the step.
After this, a video clip of the next step in the task was presented and so forth until
the completion of the task. The skills necessary to make microwave popcorn were
acquired and maintained even after video prompting was withdrawn at the 10-week
follow-up.


Discussion:
With respect to the first category of
communication studies,
assistive technology has been successfully used to develop a range of communication
skills, including requesting preferred objects and activities, rejecting nonpreferred
objects and activities, naming/labeling objects/pictures, and initiating
conversational exchanges. However, it would appear that most of the research has
to date focused on teaching what might be viewed as relatively beginning communication
skills for basic self-regulation functions (e.g., requesting preferred
objects). Given the potential for assistive technology to enable much more
sophisticated and complex communication interactions, there would seem to be
some value in extending the existing literature to explore the use of these types of
assistive communication technologies for enabling participants with ASD to enter
into more complex and prolonged communicative exchanges.
Most of the studies into the use of assistive communication technologies for
individuals with ASD were conducted in home, school, or clinical settings and
with communicative partners who were familiar with the child and with the nature
of the assistive technology. This raises the important clinical issue as to the
effectiveness of PECS, SGD-, and CBI-based communication in community settings
with unfamiliar listeners.

With respect to the second category of studies targeting social and emotional
skills
assistive technology
has been successfully used to develop a range of social/emotional skills, including
responding to facial expressions, identifying emotional states (e.g., anger, anxiety),
using social gestures, initiating social interactions, and recruiting attention/
interaction. This range covers a number of the areas that have been described as
causing problems for people with ASD, but the literature is somewhat limited in
that other important areas have not yet been covered (e.g., empathy). Given the
potential for assistive technology to assist individuals with ASD in these areas of
social difficulty, there would seem to be some value in extending the existing
literature to explore the use of these types of assistive communication technologies
for enabling participants with ASD to acquire other social skills and learn to
identify and appropriately express a wider range of emotions.
The literature in the social/emotional area is also limited with respect to the
range of assistive technology employed. Most studies have used CBI or video
modeling. There would seem to be scope for investigating other (portable) technologies
for addressing the needs in the social/emotional areas, such as perhaps
iPhones, virtual reality, and robotics. Still, the results of these 11 studies were
sufficiently impressive to make the case for using assistive technology within a
more general systematic instructional approach for teaching new social/emotional
skills to persons with ASD.

With respect to the third and final category of studies targeting daily living and
other adaptive skills
assistive technology can successfully used to develop a range of daily living/
adaptive behavior skills, including preparing meals/snacks, using office and
household appliances, locating grocery store items, signaling a bus to stop,
washing hands, mailing a letter, caring from pets, setting the table, washing dishes,
and folding laundry.
The diversity of skills suggests that assistive
technology may have relatively broad applicability in the daily living/adaptive
skills domain.The literature in the daily living/adaptive behavior skills area is,
however, somewhat limited with respect to the range of assistive technology
employed. As was the situation in the social skills domain, most studies in the
daily living/adaptive skills domain have used CBI or video modeling (e.g., Jowlett
2012; Moore et al. 2013; Shrestha et al. 2013). While effective, there would seem
to be considerable potential perhaps for evaluating newer emerging assistive
technology to assist persons with ASD in the performance of daily living/adaptive
behavior skills.

Use of Technology in Interventions for Children with Autism

This review will focus on five examples of technology introduced as a temporary instructional aid
to be removed once the goal of behavior change has been met: (a) tactile and auditory prompting devices,
(b) video-based instruction and feedback, (c) computer-aided instruction, (d) virtual reality, and (e)
robotics

Mechanical Prompts
Individuals with autism often need external stimulus prompts to initiate, maintain, or terminate a
behavior. Commonly used prompts include vocal, gestural, physical, written/pictorial, and signed
prompts, and each modality has been demonstrated effective for multiple purposes (MacDuff, Krantz, &
McClannahan, 2001).
The two most commonly use mechanical prompts are auditory and
tactile prompts.

Evaluating the Effectiveness
of Video Instruction on Social
and Communication Skills Training
for Children With Autism Spectrum
Disorders: A Review of the Literature

Video instruction generally comprises several techniques
including video modeling (VM), video self-modeling (VSM),
and point-of-view video modeling (PVM). VM is described
as a process where (a) a person is asked to watch a video
prior to instruction in the target skill, (b) the target skill is
modeled by an adult or peer within the activity context,
(c) the instructor provides prompts and reinforcers to the
person for attending to relevant stimuli, and (d) the person
then imitates the behavior of the model when provided with
the opportunity to perform the skills displayed in the video
(Bellini & Akullian, 2007; Graetz, Mastropieri, & Scruggs,
2006; Sigafoos, O’Reilly, & de la Cruz, 2007).
Similar to VM, VSM involves the use of the individual
being instructed as the model in the videotape instead of
adults, peers, or siblings. VSM is described as a process
where (a) only the exemplary target behavior of the student

is displayed on the videotape minus teacher prompts and
reinforcers (Hitchcock, Dowrick, & Prater, 2003), (b) the
student observes his/her own adaptive behavior in the video
(Buggey, 2005), (c) the student is provided with opportunities
to imitate his/her own target behaviors after watching
the video (Bellini, Akullian, & Hopf, 2007; Hine & Wolery,
2006; Schreibman et al., 2000), and (d) after watching oneself
engaging only in the appropriate behavior, the student’s
actual behavior also tends to change (Coyle & Cole, 2004).

In contrast to the use of others or self as models for
appropriate behavior, PVM has been defined as the process
of videotaping elements of the environment or activity context
from the visual perspective or vantage point of the student
who needs to acquire and/or master the target responses
(Hine & Wolery, 2006; Schreibman et al., 2000; Shipley-
Benamou, Lutzker, & Taubman, 2002). The videographer
records steps for completing an activity or transitions from
one setting to another by actually navigating through the
process at the eye level of the student. When students review
the videotape, they see exactly what they are supposed to do
from the beginning until the end of the task or routine. Such
a technique, when viewed repeatedly, promotes visual comprehension,
increases familiarity with materials and settings,
and provides a “picture” of the completed process, ostensibly
reducing task anxiety and inappropriate behavior.

video instruction has gained momentum in recent
years in the pursuit of effective practices for social skills
instruction for individuals with ASD


VM Interventions
The purpose of VM is to allow a student to see the appropriate
actions for performing the target behavior immediately
prior to performing the skill, increasing the probability of
successful performance. Students watch a short video clip
of discrete target behaviors in its entirety before performing
these behaviors or watch a clip of one step, perform the
step, and continue the same until the task procedure is
completed. For discrete behaviors of short durations, a 3-
to 5-min video clip is generally considered to be adequate
given the relatively low attending skills of students with
ASD (Buggey, 2005).


VM as the primary intervention without additional intervention
components.
During intervention, if participants initiated an interaction
(e.g., asked a question, made a comment), the experimenter
responded accordingly; however, the response was not a
prompt, correction, or reinforcer.

participants
not only acquired the target skills but also maintained and/or
generalized the target responses to untrained people, objects,
and settings.

Many educators assume
that all instructional situations targeting novel skills require
the use of antecedent prompts to evoke correct responding,
the use of error correction procedures to promote accurate
responding, and reinforcers to maintain the rate of occurrence.
In each of these studies, researchers used stimulus
materials that promoted acquisition of skills in the absence
of prompts, corrections, and reinforcers.


VM as the primary intervention with additional intervention
components (e.g., instructional prompts and reinforcers).

VM in these
studies was accompanied by the use of instructional prompts;
tangible, edible, or verbal reinforcers; redirection (e.g.,
Paterson & Arco, 2007); or review of video content after the
viewing (Charlop-Christy & Daneshvar, 2003; Taylor et al.,
1999) for training on target skills.

VM as one component of a multielement intervention package.

additional components were
added when VM alone did not increase the target responses
of participants. These multielement interventions included
not only instructional prompts to evoke correct responding
and tangible or verbal reinforcers for correct responses but
also other teacher-directed strategies contingent upon incorrect
responding.

The implication of adding these intervention components
to VM is the need to evaluate the reasons why VM
alone was ineffective in producing the desired target
responses. Specific attention needs to be paid to the elements
of the video itself, for example, the length of each
video clip watched by participants (only some studies
reported the length), the number of viewings, time lapse
between video-viewing and opportunity to perform the target
response, and whether experimenters conducted debriefing
sessions with participants after watching the video clip.
The implication is to document the procedural fidelity of
implementation of the various components of the intervention
package.

VM compared to another intervention strategy to determine
relative effects of each intervention.
In other words, children in the VM condition did experience
at least one demonstration of in-vivo modeling of the correct
response, making the comparison between VM and invivo
technically not equal or comparable
Sherer et al. (2001) compared the
effectiveness of VM to VSM on target skills.
participants with the highest level of performance on target
responses in the Sherer et al. study also indicated greater
preference for visual stimuli and qualitatively better visual
memories.
This finding relates to the need for assessing visual preferences
of participants prior to using video instruction as an
intervention strategy.


VSM Interventions
VSM differs from VM in that VSM involves videotaping
the participant instead of other adults, peers, or siblings as a
model. 

The assumption is that there is no better model similar
in age, gender, race, and other characteristics than oneself
(Bandura, 1969; Buggey, Toombs, Gardener, & Cervetti,
1999). VSM interventions usually fall into two categories
(Dowrick, 1999), positive self-review and video feed forward.
Positive self-review refers to individuals viewing
themselves successfully engaging in a behavior or activity
that is already in their repertoire or one they are learning. In
video feed forward interventions, individuals observe themselves
successfully demonstrating skills that are slightly
above their current capability. The positive self-review
form of VSM has been used as an intervention strategy for
individuals with autism.

Using VSM to teach social skills to students with autism
can be challenging for several reasons. First, videotape samples
of students displaying exemplary behavior are generally
accumulated over time by encouraging the students to
role-play or imitate the target behavior (Buggey et al., 1999;
Delano, 2007). Second, obtaining the child’s cooperation
with task demands for videotaping can be time consuming,
especially if the target skill is novel (Bellini & Akullian,
2007; Sherer et al., 2001). Third, VSM necessitates acquisition
of the target response at some level in order to videotape,
which can be difficult for skills that a student has not
acquired.

Interpretation of the results of these four
studies showed that overall, VSM increased target responses
such as social initiations and engagement, response to others’
questions, and spontaneous requests. Bellini et al. (2007)
found while the absolute mean rate of social interactions
of both participants increased relative to baseline and
the percentage of non-overlapping data for intervention
was 80%, the behavioral pattern of both children showed
high variability (Range 5%–75%, Participant 1; Range
0%–50%, Participant 2) throughout the intervention
and maintenance phases, undermining the impact of the
intervention.
There is
limited evidence on the effectiveness of VSM as an intervention
strategy for improving the social and communication
responses of students with ASD. Clearly, further research
is warranted to determine what child characteristics make
VSM an effective intervention strategy.

PVM Instruction
PVM requires videotaping elements of the environment or
activity from the vantage point of the student.
Schreibman et al. (2000) used PVM as an antecedent strategy
to make transition routines more predictable for students
in order to decrease their problem behavior.
PVM might be a promising intervention strategy; however,
further research is needed to proclaim PVM as an effective
intervention.







The use of instructional prompts and reinforcers or
error correction appears to be more effective for
promoting acquisition, maintenance, and generalization
of target skills. In some studies, the addition
of reinforcement or prompting and feedback were
necessary to improve the frequency of targets. This
is critical as educators advocate the use of systematic
instruction involving a sequence of prompts,
corrective feedback, reinforcers, and opportunities
to practice to promote learning of complex
behaviors such as social and/or communication
skills.

It is necessary to evaluate the child’s skills in
attending, imitation, visual processing and comprehension,
matching-to-sample, and spatial ability in
order to determine the amount of content and the
length of the video.

3. Children who are able to attend to a video for at
least 1 min are more likely to benefit from this
instructional strategy when compared to students
who are more distracted by irrelevant features like
“noise” (conversation), clothes of the actors, or
other features (Nikopoulos & Keenan, 2003).

The type of model (peer, familiar or unfamiliar
adult, or self) did not appear to affect student learning
in any manner. It appears that all types of models
could be effective.

\section{Interview Transcription}
The recorded interviews between the researcher and the parent are transcribed by the researcher into written texts for qualitative analysis later.  The purpose of such analysis is to generate themes or hypotheses in the contexts of robot design recommendations and interpreting robot prompt effectiveness, thus only conversations relevant to these contexts are transcribed from the recorded interviews.

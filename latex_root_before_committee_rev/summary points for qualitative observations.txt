phase A notes:
- get soap, lather, turn on water, rinse, turn off water, dry
- child prefers turn on water then lather in water

compare parent and robot prompts:
prompt:
- step used
- verbal used
- gesture used
- timing of prompts
- reward (AG, intro, outro), gaze
child reception:
		- compliance score table
- able to complete the hand-washings?
- always start soap first
- X wait for first step if parent don't prompt proactive
- sometimes not complying to terminate get soap, need to use physical interventions
- X wait for turn on water prompt
- always start rinsing by himself after turning on water
- terminate rinse by himself after 8 seconds
- V follow rinse more prompt, but terminate afte 1 second
- V wait for prompt befor turn off water
- always start drying by himself after turning off water
- dry step quality is poor
- terminate dry by himself after 8 seconds
noncompliance strategies:
- ...
confusions:
- rinse again prompt -> child got soap before starting rinse
fatigues seen by playing with bubbles and noncompliance behaviors
repeat verbal prompts as he processes it

first phase B notes:
- robot delay 4 seconds prompt execution, 2 sec pause between same prompts, 4-8 sec pause between diff prompts
- turn on water, get soap, rinse.
- always get soap first, despite robot repeated prompts
- not always waiting for first prompts?
- start rinse by himself immediately after turn on water
- verbal reward prior to rinse, causing delay.  changed to no rewards after few trials.  better flow, no effect on child's enthusiasm.
- rinse 4 seconds then terminate by himself
- does not rinse more upon hearing rinse prompt
- does not wait for turn off water prompt, terminate dry and leave by himself
- first step prompted proactively, others prompted reactively or correctively due to robot delays, and many no prompts
- compliance was nonexistent
noncompliance strategies:
- repeat prompt
- AG
- parent intervention
-> both not working, and parent intervention sometimes not working verbally, had to be physically intervened
Gaze:
- more gaze in beginning of phase, but lost gaze interest quickly as trials progressed, correlated to whether child waits for robot?





phase C notes:
immediate changes due to parent involvement
 - steps prompted
gradual changes
 - changes observed through out first and second phase B and phase C
 - changes unique to phase C





to report phase b and c:
describe robot prompt and compare with parent
describe robot prompt changes
describe different stages of parent joint prompts
describe child reactions and change in reactions in each phases (and stages)
summarise and compare child reactions across phases
	- phase a, first phase b, first visit phase c, after first visit phase c, second phase b

don't care about duration if C doesn't stop before next prompt since we are only interested in how long can we get C to continue rinse before C decides to stop, and later on if C does fake compliance by rinsing 1 seconds or less.
-> unless there's reward and if C decides to stop after rewarded


compliance means: attempts the right step? or just attempt any step at all?
if wrong step, what standard for saying C complies?
-	how do we know if C deliberately disobeyed the command, how can we be sure C understood the command correctly?
	- if C was doing some step, and due to prompt, C does another step, then C complied
	- if C was doing some step, and after prompt, C doesn't change its behaviour, then C didn't comply
		- or if we know for sure C knows what the prompt means (C just followed it a second ago), but does another step in response to prompt (i.e. deliberately disobeys prompt)
==> maybe we should log only the initial step, success?, and the second step, success.  then derive compliance later on

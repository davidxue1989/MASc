	right step => wrong step
	right step => no step
	wrong step => wrong step, different
	wrong step => wrong step, same
wrong step => right step

wrong step => wrong step, same
no step => no step

no step => wrong step
	- maybe no effects from prompt, C decides to move on to new step
	- maybe C misunderstood the prompt

prompt working, i.e. compliance:
	right step => right step extend and same
	wrong step => right step
	no step => right step
------------------------------------------------------> C did some stuff

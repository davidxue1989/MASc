measures after annotation:

task completion after prompt:
if attempted a step after prompt:
	if non-extended step
	and hasn't started this step before prompt:
		attempts after prompt ++
		if completed: [and P prompt gesture isn't physical intervention]
			task completion after prompt ++
	if extended step:
		for each chunk of consecutive prompt sections that have same task:
			attempts after prompt ++
			task completion after prompt += percentage of prompt sections that have tasks completed after prompt [and P prompt gesture isn't physical intervention]
avg completion rate = task completion after prompt / task attempted after prompt

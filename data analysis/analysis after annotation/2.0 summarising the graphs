basically, we should show
1. compliance is the issue (robot alone vs p alone)
2. we were able to improve compliance (robot alone rep vs robot alone)
3. what did we do to get there
	i) faster response rate (5 secs per prompt, although even faster is desired)
	ii) p's robot compliance prompts and behind the back physical prompts (what difference do these serve? first is for compliance, second is for learning to turn take?  show the impacts of these on R alone rep responses (compliance graph and task attempted rate - before prompt graph))
	iii) C got more used to listening to the robot or got better at the sequence of hand-washing steps? (probably both, but which effect is more intense?)

effectiveness of robot prompts:
total number of incomplete tasks - before parent prompts, compared against total number of incomplete tasks - before parent or robot prompts
total number of parent prompts - non-physical
total number of parent prompts - physical, total number of incomplete tasks - before parent physical prompts

learning hand-washing:
total number of incomplete tasks - before parent or robot prompts

Learning to wait for robot's instructions:
task attempted rate - before prompt

compliance:
compliance rate - overall
Compliance Rate - R1Pv0g0
Hard compliance rate - overall
Hard Compliance rate - R1Pv0g0

other responses:
Not affected by prompt rate - overall
confused by prompt rate - overall

engagement:
- smile
- distracted
- murmurs
X visual attention during prompts?




- when P physical involvement increases, C attempts tasks less before prompt
- children with ASD react so fast, waiting for them to look, and then execute prompts, this process takes too long.  they'll get bored and stop following R.
- C's performance drastically improved in t5-s7, when P stands behind C.  So this proves it's not C not knowing the steps or R's prompts are not understandable, but it's a compliance issue for our particular participant
- C can wash hands on their own, but R is useful in getting C started.  But R is not useful in getting C to rinse or dry more... ?
- C closes ears with hands when R prompts during trial 3, I asked P if R volume too loud, P says it's alirght
- soap first made a huge difference..
- the fatigue issue is a real thing, the father in trial 6 repeatedly states that the reason why C isn't performing as desired is because of the repetitiveness of the activities.  However, we should also report how much rest is C getting in between sessions?
- AG wasn't really effective.  If C is occupied with a step, no matter how many times AG is issued, C won't stop or look
- P gives reward only occasionally (not every step), focusing on hard steps and always gives one at the end when child is all done.

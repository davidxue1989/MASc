rationale: to analyse different prompt types / conditions on what influences compliance:
	"the what and the how" of a prompt
		comprehension (clarity of meaning and comprehensible delivery)
	"the why" of a prompt
		authority
		fun / engaging
		appropriate prompting modality (but this may be prompting agent dependent, or at least how C sees the role of the prompting agent)
		recognize that the instruction is helpful (C knows he needs it)


The analysis framework:
		
compare between:
4 P alone
3 P behind C
2 P prompts for step
1 P prompts for compliance
0 P behind door
===>

Real world scenario of R compared against P:
P alone vs. P behind door (4v0)

	With a little authority scenario of R compared against P:
	P alone vs. P prompts for compliance (4v1)

	Best case scenario of R compared against P:	
	P alone vs. P behind C (4v3)

	How far is R from missing the mark given a real world scenario:
	P behind C vs. P behind door (3v0)

Compliance issue of C in presence of R:
P prompts for step vs. P behind door (2v0)

	The presence of R, does it help or hinder P's prompts:
	P alone vs. P prompts for step (4v2)
	
	Effect of a little more authority to R:
	P prompts for compliance vs. P behind door (1v0)

	Understandability of P's prompts vs R's prompts:
	P prompts for step vs. P prompts for compliance (2v1)

C learning to take turn in the prompting scenario with R

C learning hand-washing steps

P behind C vs. P prompts for step

How far is R from missing the mark given a little authority:
P behind C vs. P prompts for compliance


===============================================================
measures of comparison:

effectiveness of prompt:
- number of P prompts
- number of P physical prompts
- task completion:
	- number of tasks not completed
	- number of tasks not completed before P physical prompts
		- avg quality of rinse and dry

prompt compliance:
- percentage of complied prompts

engagement, visual attention, other indicators

================================================================
shall we do a varying threshold of p prompt levels on affecting C incomplete tasks?
-> no! just do the number of incomplete tasks given the following:
	with P full step physical prompts,
	without P full step physical prompts (but still allow nudge and guide),
	without P prompts,
	without any P or R prompts
		do we care whether it's a level 2 or a level 1 completion? let's try including level 1 first, if it's too loose and noninformative, we'll do level 2
		==> after testing, they don't make much of a difference. let's just include level 1
	
shall we do number of p prompts issued each session, varying threshold on the p prompt levels, e.g. number of p prompts that are or are below P verbal[0,2]gesture[7] (i.e. all the P prompts)?
-> no! just do:
	number of P prompts that are physical (nudge, guide, or full step),
	number of P prompts that are not physical,
	number of P prompts total, 
	number of robot prompts, 
	number of prompts total

compliance
	- given different conditions / criteria of the prompt, what's C's behaviour likely to be. i.e. compliance rate given prompt type
	- prompt types:
		-  R[1] P verbal[0]gesture[0] [robot alone]
		vs R[0] P verbal[1]gesture[0,1,2][about robot]
		vs R[0] P verbal[0]gesture[1,2][about object without talking]
		vs R[0] P verbal[2]gesture[0,1,2][about object with talking]
		vs R[0] P verbal[0,2]gesture[3,4][about step with salient gestures]
		vs R[0] P verbal[0,2]gesture[5,6][about compliance with more influence]
		vs R[0] P verbal[0,2]gesture[7][about compliance with force]
		
		vs R[1] P verbal[1]gesture[0,1,2][about robot with R]
		vs R[1] P verbal[0]gesture[1,2][about object without talking with R]
		vs R[1] P verbal[2]gesture[0,1,2][about object with talking with R]
		vs R[1] P verbal[0,2]gesture[3,4][about step with salient gestures with R]
		vs R[1] P verbal[0,2]gesture[5,6][about compliance with more influence with R]
		vs R[1] P verbal[0,2]gesture[7][about compliance with force with R]

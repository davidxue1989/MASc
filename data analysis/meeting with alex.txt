x-axis of series data:
draw line through each phase
draw vertical line between phase

chpt 5 of ob

independence as C alone or C with R
so independence from P

P vs R:
phase A, B use independence plot
ignored prompts plots (compliance)
number of interactions between P and R => lump all prompts from P (hopefully less in phase B since R comes in)

R vs R n P:

visual attention

ACM and others for technical
have an understanding of all literatures in AT for ASD
critically analyze them
why i'm doing what i'm doing

instead of sessions in trials, call all sessions trials! so we have ~54 trials across the phases A-B-B'
for limitation:
- ~8 trials happening consecutively in a day -> more learning effects and fatigue compared to spreading to 1 trial a day

 does he know which step to do without prompt
 does he take turns and waits for the prompts
 does he know the step's motions
 does P ever uses AG?  does it ever work?
 
 C is never in rest position when R is in primary role of prompting, but C does wait for P during P-C sessions.
 
 what percentage of steps does C attempt but don't know how?
	=> should be close to zero
	

items that aren't useful:
	- distracted (just report distracted instances whenever it occurs)
	- waiting for C to need help before prompt
	- was child waiting for R to prompt
	- mimicks the motions
	- successfully executes with prompt

	
for p-r-c:
- p usually don't prompt unless c doesn't follow r, so just check:
	- 
	
	
Exceptions:
intro: only care about P/R prompted,  AG, look, mimick, and notes (anything else C did towards R)
turn on/off water: don't look at C stops step before next prompt, duration, unit
all done: don't look at C stops step before next prompt, duration, unit
attempted step completed is yes for rinse / scrub / dry if the motion is correct (don't care about duration)
	=> this means they know the step's motion. 
if C attempts step without prompt, we don't look at C reaction section, only C execution section.

1) C looks at object of prompted step
2) C looks at object of attempted step (if attempted step differs from prompted)
==> if not prompted or attempted step is the same as prompted step, don't look at 1), only 2)
==> else if attempted step differs from prompted, look at both 1) and 2)


if C execution and R prompt starts within 1 second from each other, C execution is considered to have started first (cause it takes time for C to process prompt after observing it).


all done's step completed just means C attempts to go out.  doesn't matter if he ended up going out.

is P prompts always C starts step before prompt == no?

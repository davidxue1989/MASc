To promote consistency and eectiveness, the implementations of ATCs for assisting children with ASD
with daily living tasks should also follow the ABA framework, and model after the DTT steps.

3. To implement a real-time algorithm for tracking child's VFOA
- Perhaps re-word this to better reflect that the goal was primarily to develop the algorithms required to do this as opposed to developing and testing a complete system.

3. Using 3DMM and ALR for estimating head pose and eye pose, and using the Kinect camera, a
classication rate of more than 80% is achieved for estimating child's VFOA on NAO, monitor
screen, soap, towel, tap region, hands, and idling.
- I would remove the hypotheses related to the VFOA as you didn't end up testing anything.

- attach SRS results, and post intervention survey, in appendix



Figure 4.5: Number of Parent Prompts - Physical Intervention
- Not clear to me why this and the above figure are in this section.  May make better sense to include them below to help explain some of the results, in particular why the mean number of steps completed decreased in phases b and c.

The parent in Phase A never prompted for the wet hands steps,
and thus it was never completed in Phase A.
- I am confused by this statement.  The below figure shows only the number of steps completed indepdentnly (i.e. without the parent providing a prompt).  So why is this relevant?

for rst Phase B is 33%, for Phase C
is 77%, and for second Phase B is 80%
- Do you break these down by number of prompts from the parent and number from the robot?

4.10.5 Quantitative Analysis and Results - Further
- I don't think that these data are very useful.  I would remove them from here.  You can use them as needed in the discussion section.
4.10.6 Qualitative Analysis and Results - Further
- I would just continue this as part of the same qualitative section above.

Thirdly, we did not employ the adequate
engagement in data collection technique satisfactorily.
- This doesn't fit here as you are start off talking about the things that you did to ensure internal validity, but here you say that you didn't do this.

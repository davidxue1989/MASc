\subsection{Video Data Measures}
To evaluate the effectiveness of the robot prompts on child's step completion, to measure the child's compliance to the prompts, and to investigate their relationships with the child's engagement level during hand-washing, the following metrics are calculated and analyzed from the video data annotations for each trial:


\paragraph{Prompt Effectiveness}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Total Number of Incomplete Steps}: the number of hand-washing steps that were prompted but the child failed to attempt or attempted but failed to complete.
	\item \textbf{Total Number of Parent Prompts}: the number of prompts delivered by the parent (e.g. verbal, pointing, motion demonstrations, nudging, guiding, and physically intervening).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Responses to Prompts}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Compliance Rate}: the percentage of prompts that the child followed correctly.
	\item \textbf{Not Affected By Prompt Rate}: the percentage of prompts that the child ignored.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Engagement and Visual Attention}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Total Number of Times Child Smiles}: the number of prompt sections that the child smiled.
	\item \textbf{Total Number of Times Child Murmurs}: the number of prompt sections that the child murmured.
	\item \textbf{Looking at Prompting Agent Rate}: the number of prompt sections that the child looked at parent when parent was prompting or at robot when robot was prompting.
\end{itemize}

The specific definitions for each measure will be discussed further in the analysis section \ref{sec:VideoDataAnalysisAndResults}.  The difference between prompts and prompt sections is discussed in \ref{sec:AnnotationFramework}.

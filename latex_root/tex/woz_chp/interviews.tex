\section{Interviews}
In addition to surveys, the parent would be interviewed by the researcher through out the breaks between trials.  The purpose of these interviews is to probe what the parent thinks about the robot, what the child's behaviors mean and why the child behaves in such ways, how to get the child to comply better, how to improve the robot further, and collect more relevant background information on the child and the family.  The interview would not be scripted, but would be a result of a free flow of conversations between the researcher and the parent, discussing what happened in each trial and what to do in the next.  The interviews were to be voice recorded and would be transcribed by the researcher for analysis.

\section{Interviews}
In addition to surveys, the parent was interviewed by the researcher through out the breaks between trials.  The purpose of these interviews was to probe what the parent thought about the robot, what the child's behaviors meant and why the child behaved in such ways, how to get the child to comply better, how to improve the robot further.  Also, the interviews served to collect more relevant background information on the child and the family.  The interview were not scripted, but were a result of a free flow of conversations between the researcher and the parent, discussing what happened in each trial and what to do in the next trial.  The interviews were voice recorded and transcribed by the researcher for analysis.

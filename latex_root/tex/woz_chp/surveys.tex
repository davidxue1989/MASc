\paragraph{Social Responsiveness Scale Survey and Entrance Survey}
The Social Responsiveness Scale Survey serves to screen participants during recruitment and were be filled out by the parent that accompanied the child to all trials.  The entrance survey was administered with the SRS survey, because it reports the child's demographics as well as inclusion criteria fit.  In addition, it also reports child's previous experiences with technologies, child's personal preferences, child's abilities on hand-washing and on other ADLs, and parent's expectation and concerns.

\paragraph{Post-Intervention Survey}
During the last visit, the same parent who completed the SRS survey and the entrance survey was be asked to fill out the post-intervention survey.  The survey reports the parent's opinion on our robot prompting system, giving suggestions and comments and how effectiveness and appropriate is the system, and any improvements or adjustments needed.

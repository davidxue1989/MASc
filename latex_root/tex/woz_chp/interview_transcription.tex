\section{Interview Transcription}
The recorded interviews between the researcher and the parent were transcribed by the researcher into written texts for qualitative analysis later.  The purpose of such analysis was to generate themes or hypotheses in the contexts of robot design recommendations and interpreting robot prompt effectiveness, thus only conversations relevant to these contexts were transcribed from the recorded interviews.

%What are we trying to find out? Why are they important?
%	- is there a difference in child's response to parent prompt vs robot prompt?
%		- visual attention
%		- compliance
%		- task performance

One major objective of this thesis is to investigate the impacts that using a humanoid prompting agent has on the visual attention, prompt compliance, and task performance of children with ASD during hand-washing activities.

This is the first research of its kind in the field of humanoid robot prompting agent guiding children with ASD through an activity of daily living.  Therefore, it is wise to begin with a pilot study, the purpose of which is to show plausibility of the key underlying assumptions of our hypotheses, and to probe what questions are important to be answered later in a more rigorous randomized control trial.  For this reason, the pilot study should be exploratory in nature, having a flexible experiment design, and relatively low experiment setup cost.

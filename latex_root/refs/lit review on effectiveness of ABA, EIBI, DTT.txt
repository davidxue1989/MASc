Applied behavior analytic intervention for autism in early childhood: Meta-analysis,
meta-regression and dose–response meta-analysis of multiple outcomes
Javier Virués-Ortega

Results suggested that long-term, comprehensive ABA intervention leads to (positive)
medium to large effects in terms of intellectual functioning, language development, acquisition of daily living skills and social functioning in children with autism. Although favorable effects were apparent across all outcomes, language-related outcomes (IQ, receptive and expressive language, communication) were superior to non-verbal IQ, social functioning and daily living skills, with effect sizes approaching 1.5 for receptive and expressive language and communication skills. Dose-dependant effect sizes were apparent by levels of total treatment hours for language and adaptation composite scores

DTT: skills are broken down into smaller (sub) skils, and taught in a restricted operant arrangement called a discrete trial.  During a DTT session many learning opportunities (e.g., up to 10 per minute) are provided to the child and te structured teaching format aides the child in isolating the key components of the learning situation by breaking down the complex behavior into units which can be easily discriminated.  The skills learned need to be actively generalized to other persons, materials and situations. Therefore, DTT is usually combined with more naturalistic approaches such as incidental teaching (Harris & Delmolino, 2002; Jensen & Sinclair, 2002; Lovaas, 2003; Smith, 2001).

opposed to typically developing children, eye-tracking studies show that children with ASD
fixate more on body parts and objects instead of faces (Klin, Jones, Schutlz, Volkmar, & Cohen,
2002; Speer, Cook, McMahon, & Clark, 2007).

In addition, children with ASD show a strong preference for highly contingent, non-variable
contingency feedback instead of the imperfect contingent feedback that is characteristic
for social interactions (Gergely & Watson, 1999).

[A Meta-Analytic Study on the Effectiveness of Comprehensive ABA-based
Early Intervention Programs for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders]
Studies have reported mixed outcomes (Eikeseth, 2009). Several descriptive reviews
have concluded that, although EIBI generally has meaningful benefits for young children
with ASD, there were large individual differences in treatment response and most children
continued to require specialized services (Eikeseth, 2009; Howlin, Magiati, & Charman,
2009; Matson & Smith, 2008; Rogers & Vismara, 2008; Shea, 2004; Smith, 1999).Two
meta-analyses (Eldevik et al., 2009; Reichow & Wolery, 2009) found an average medium to
large effect size for IQ change despite using different effect sizes (standardized mean change
effect size versus a standardized mean difference effect size) and differences in study selection
criteria. Eldevik et al. (2009) also found a medium effect size on change of the adaptive
behavior composite.

Children with ASD participating in EIBI generally outperformed children receiving other
treatments or treatment as usual on both IQ and adaptive behavior measures. This confirms
findings from other studies on EIBI (Eikeseth, 2009; Howlin et al., 2009) and two other recent
meta-analyses (Eldevik et al., 2009; Reichow &Wolery, 2009). The average differences of
11.09 to 15.21 standardized points in scores between the experimental and control groups
on IQ, non-verbal IQ and receptive and expressive language and the large effect sizes may be
considered clinically significant (Hojat & Gang, 2004).
Consistent with Eldevik et al. (2009), this study found smaller differences on adaptive
behavior between the experimental and the control group (4.96–10.44 points) suggesting
that future applied work might focus more intensively to improve child
adaptive behavior.





[ref: Behavioral interventions in adolescents and young adults
with high-functioning ASD:
Improvement, generalization, and maintenance of adaptive skills]

In their sample of adults with HFASD, Farley
et al. (2009) found that among a range of variables including IQ, adaptive behavior measures
(Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales – VABS; Sparrow et al., 1984) were the variables most
closely and positively related to better outcome. Across the adaptive domains the ‘daily living
skills’ domain was most highly associated with better outcome.

although the difficulties in acquiring daily living skills may be due to deficiencies in cognitive functions given by the three theories, criticisms of using cognitive skills training as interventions are that: it has
been found that improvements in adaptive behaviors may not automatically result in
improvements in cognitive skills (e.g., Chin & Bernard-Opitz, 2000; Teunisse et al., 2007).  Thus, instead of targeting the cognitive skills, which might not generalize into adaptive behaviors, we can seek to target the behaviors themselves, hence ABA.

Discrete trial teaching (DTT; e.g.,
Howard, Sparkman, Cohen, Green, & Stanislaw, 2005), incidental teaching (IT; e.g., McGee,
Krantz, & McClannahan, 1986), and pivotal response training (PRT; e.g., Koegel, Carter, &
Koegel, 2003) are interventions effectively used in adaptive skill building in children with
ASD and are based on ABA methodology.

===>  similar study results to ours, that training phase increased task engagement:
[ref: Task engagement in young adults with high-functioning autism spectrum
disorders: Generalization effects of behavioral skills training]
The
study demonstrated that a time-limited behavioral skills training package, implemented in a
therapy room, resulted in a statistically significant decrease in off-task behavior during
regular job training. Furthermore, results were more or less maintained at 6-week and at 6-
month follow-up. The significant decrease in ‘off-task behavior’ could neither be attributed to
an increased presence of the job trainer nor to an increased use of response prompting or
reinforcement by the job trainer as no significant changes between conditions were found on
these variables. It can be concluded that the skill of remaining engaged with tasks generalized
from the therapy room (using unknown tasks, under supervision of the experimenter) to the
natural job-training setting while performing regular job-tasks under supervision of the
regular job trainer. The use of self-management, a visual cue (i.e., flowchart), and behavioral
practice using multiple stimulus- (e.g., verbal and/or visual task instruction on several
unknown tasks) and response exemplars (i.e., several task engagement responses) may have
contributed to the generalization effects (see e.g., Koegel et al., 1995; Stokes & Osnes, 1989).
